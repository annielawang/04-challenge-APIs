## Usage
Users can go to the website and see a start quiz page. By clicking on the start button, the user will be taken to the question page. When the user click on any answer, another question will show up until the last question or time reaches 0. If the user answer the question wrong, 15 seconds will be taken away from the total time left until it reaches 0.
